== Tables

To make a table, create each column's header with three or more hyphens (---), and separate each column with pipes (|).

{{<table "table">}}
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
{{</table>}}

You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.

{{<table "table">}}

{{</table>}}

To automatically generate the table by simply assigning values to the cells, use the [Markdown Table Generator Tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).
